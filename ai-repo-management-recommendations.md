# AI Repo Management Recommendations

The project is primarily geared towards **knowledge management**, and an important part of its success is making it easy for anyone to contribute and improve it.

LLMs help with that, as you don't have to understand as much about the whole codebase to accomplish a useful task.

There are several efforts in the space:
- **[GitHub Next](https://githubnext.com/)** is the most interesting project, as they already have done a PR LLM bot and have moved it into the product phase.
- **[Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot)** to make it easy for the open source community to add functionality to github.
- **[Agenthub](https://www.agenthub.dev/)** offers a nice visual flow editor and some prebuilt github bots.
- **[ChatDev](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev)** creates files/projects directly with natural commands, has a `incremental``mode.


## Ideal State:
You find a bug, tell the LLM what the problem is, it takes a shot at it, you have a tight feedback loop, and get the change out as quickly as possible in the way that you envionsed. 

- **VS Code Extension**: Add an extension to VS Code that allows you to request a change in the repo. The extension should provide a sample plan, allow you to execute it, and push up a PR. The PR should be automatically checked and approved. Codespaces should be set up for one-click deployment with the extension installed, along with a video tutorial.

- **Performance Balanced with Speed**:
    - Efforts should prioritize higher quality PRs over the speed of PRs. Consider implementing a bot to break down tasks.

- **PR Response**:
    - Explore the possibility of AI responding to PR comments with a new commit to reduce back-and-forth discussions, assuming the quality is high enough.
        - Trust that the most powerful models will be able to handle larger context windows and maintain high performance eventually, making this an easier point to achieve.
        - This would allow for "automatic" high-level comments.
