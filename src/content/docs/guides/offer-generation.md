description: The core of your business.

In $100M offers, Alex Hormozi talks about how the core of your business is your offer.

The best offer is one that is so good that the person feels stupid saying say no to.

His example offer is essentially a high priced guaranteed weight loss program that addresses every aspect of the problem with losing weight, from eating, to working out, to accountability, to traveling, to socializing. Every possible problem has a complete solution and you sell the whole package.

Let's build some tools to help with this process

### Step 1: Dream Outcome

1. Start with your current offer
   > Gym membership
1. What is the dream outcome of your customer? What do they really want?
    > To lose weight
1. How can you be specific about that dream outcome? Combine specific numbers with a time frame.
    > Lose 20 pounds in 6 weeks

### Step 2: List Problems

1. What happens immediately before/after they buy your product?
    > After buying a gym membership they need to buy healthy food
2. Go into insane detail with the problems the have with each of the above steps. Think through every one of their objections
    > When trying to buy healthy food they'll think:
    > - Buying healthy food is hard, confusing, and I won’t like it
    > - Buying healthy food will take too much time
    > - Buying healthy food is expensive
    > - I will not be able to cook healthy food forever. My family’s needs will get in my way. If I travel I won’t know what to get.
3. For each of the problems above, align it with the 4 value drivers: 
   1. max enjoyment of dream outcome
   2. max perceived likelihood of achievement
   3. min length of time delay
   4. min effort and sacrifice.
