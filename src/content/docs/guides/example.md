description: The open source SAAS startup guide.
---

Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.

## So what are we trying to do?

1. Create tools to help make your next SAAS startup easier
1. Create an open source repo of startup knowledge.
1. Meet other cool developers

### SAAS Tools

> "One of the difficult things to understand about AI is that it is a general purpose technology, meaning that it's not useful only for one thing but it's useful for lots of different applications, kind of like electricity. If I were to ask you, what is electricity good for? It's not any one thing, it's a lot of things... And I think, a good way to think about AI is as a collection of tools."

Tools are things that solve problems. Think a hammer and nails to build a house. You have the blueprints, the wood, the land, but the tools put the raw ingredients together and build your vision.

This is possible today in a whole new way because LLMs are general reasoning engines. You can ask AI to categorize and generate data. Our thesis is that a majority of business tasks can be broken down into subtaks that involve these processes.

:::note
**We value effectiveness first, then productivity, then sustainability. The goal is fast time to product-market fit, not to only use free tools.**

As an example rather than building your own form for your own site to conduct market research, we'd recommend you use TypeForm so you can focus on the busines value of the form. However, we may recommend that you build your own app with a full code tools because low code tools such as webflow may lack out on being able to deliver your MVP. However if we recommend a propriatry tool, we want to make sure that there is always an escape hatch, even if it's a manual process. The first rule is never lose everything.

Some examples of startup problems and tools that could solve them

#### Market Validation

- **Problem:** I need to talk to customers
- **Solution** You have a list of appointments with customers, a script of questions, tips for getting the most out of the conversation, good and bad examples to learn from, and feedback from a coach about how to improve your conversations.
- **Tools**: Customer research bot that looks up and prepares a spreadsheet of customers, a self service scheduling tool for them to use, a bot to generate a startup script based on your ideas, a list of reserouces, a transcription service, a custom GPT to help you improve, data aggrigation from interviews

#### Offer Generation

- **Problem:** I don't know what to sell
- **Solution** Make them an offer that they'd feel stupid saying no to
- **Tools**: Offer generation process, user story genration, idea to business plan with profit projections generation

#### Advertising

- **Problem:** I need to let people know about what I do
- **Solution** Run advertising experiments, write ad copy, track reach and cost-to-acquire to total lifetime proft ratio
- **Tools**: Facebook ad generation, ad tracking service, analytics tools intergration for your website

### Create an open source repo of startup knowledge.

#### **Axioms**

1. Win-Win situations are possible; the world is not zero-sum.
1. Collaboration creates better ideas.

We're inspired by open source knowledge projects ranging from world changing such as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About) to small and niche like [Tech Interview Handbook](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook). Having people be able to not just give feedback but actively contribute to one centralized place goes beyond the capabilities of any one person. In doing so they improve the community and create a situation where someone else can solve a problem for them before they even know it exists.

Traditionally business advice sits behind lock and key. There is still value in that and we believe in defending profit motives. We're all here to make more money. However, we believe that the means of production is the most valuable part of a business, not the ideas themselves. Coca-cola is valuable in our eyes, not because of it's secret formula, but because of their massive distribution ability. Open sourcing advanced tools helps you produce something valuable

This is held up by several authors. First Walter Isaccson's The Innovators, which tries to prove that the internet came about because of many faceless people collaborating rather than lone genisus. Second, Where Good Ideas Come From by Steven Johnson, which says that the best ideas come from a free flow of information, not in isolation.
