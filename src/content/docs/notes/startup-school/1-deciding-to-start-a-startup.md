## Deciding to start a startup
Should you start a startup?

No predefined formula

Sterotype:
1. Brillant programmer like Mark Zuckerberg
2. Charismatic leader like Steve Jobs
3. Business genius like Richard Branson

Can't look at school or work track record.

It's the grit through rejection that matters. 

How do you know if you have enough resilience to start a startup?

Not confidence. It matters how you handle tough times, not good times. 

Benchling - softly spoken engineers, took years to reach first sales, transformed into powerful founder, now worth billions.

Fine for initial motivation to start a start up to make money, if you're just curious, or if you want to change the world.

Most important is that those motivations can transform into genuine interest in the problem and a love for the people you work with.

Basically if your curious, resilient, and are looking to build a good team, you should start a startup.

## Tactical Advice
**First Question: What do I have to lose?**

Assumptions: You will need at least a year to get results from an experiment. You will make no money for that year. 

Can you handle the worst case?

You will also learn a lot from starting a company. You can literally transition into any role your company touched because you will need to build every aspect of the company. 

Also good for job prospects. You will meet other smart people. You will also be a valuable asset for other companies because you are a self starter and leader.

I was able to get a job at Capital One paying 150k+ with no prior experience other than my own startup and freelance work I did for friends.

### How to prepare to start a startup if you can't start one right now

Two things to pursue together:
1. Idea
2. Co-founder

Talk to people about your idea. It will start fuzzy and through feedback you will get something concrete. Having someone to talk through that initial idea is through conversations with your co-founder.

Ask yourself: Who do you enjoy talking about ideas with?

Talk about ideas and tech that interest you. Talk about product that you use everyday that you admire. Talk about technologies you think are underrated and why. 

Flesh your thoughts out and debate them.

Eventually you'll notice more startup ideas.

#### What if I don't have people to talk to?
Change your environment and work to meet more people.

Let's focus on some tactics here. As I feel like this is where most people are. They don't have a co-founder to talk about ideas with and they're looking for a community.
