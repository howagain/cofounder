title: Learn to Build a Startup

This is quite the journey. Learning to build a startup

I like startup school's education. Here are their modules:
1. Deciding to start a startup
2. Getting and evaluating startup ideas
3. Building your founding team
4. Planning an MVP
5. Launching
6. Growing and monetizing
7. Fundraising and company building

So we'll do our best to build off of their structure. Decorating each as we try to build a startup with the next set of goals. The hope is that people can work on their own startups and contribute to this guide to help them along the way.

# Deciding to start a startup

What matters is your background, ability to learn, and grit to keep going when things get tough. Try to find an unfair advantage.

Plan to take at least 1 year per startup experiment. YOu'll need financial support for that year and you should assume that you'll make $0 during that time. 

Your first level is complete when you have
1. Have an idea
2. Have a co-founder
