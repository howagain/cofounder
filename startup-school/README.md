Startup school is a course by YC. It has some of the best information on the internet for how to fund a startup and a great cofounder matching service. 

The goal of this project is to extract a summary of the content, turn it into actionable content, and a series of tools that you can use to apply it to your unique situation. 


Here's the overview on the Cirriculum. As content is made these links will adjust to link to the page of the content, until then they link to the content itself.
