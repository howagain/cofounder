# Introduction

I've heard that talking with customers is something that you should do when starting a business. I've tried it before with mixed success. I want to know how to do it.

Our goal is to understand the following questions.

1. Why does it help
1. When should you talk with customers when you are first starting?
1. What does talking with customers actually mean (and ideally look like)?
1. What are the key questions to ask?
1. What should you avoid?
1. Where can I find people?
1. What if no one responds?
1. What if I'm scared?
1. What if I'm not sure of my business idea?

## Key Research Resources

## Key outcomes
1. I feel more confident in my startup Waterstone (as measured by a survey before and after)

4. I have a video report of the startup idea
